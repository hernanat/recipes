# Lower-Fillter Maryland Style Crab Cake Recipe by Popular Demand

## Ingredients

This is for a single batch, you can scale ingredients for however many lbs of crab meat you have. Some ingredients are "ish" because
  it's personal preference honestly.

## Base / Binding

- 1 large egg (for binding)
- 1/4-ish cup mayo (also for binding)
- 2-3tsp dijon, depending on your mustard pref
- 2-3 tsp worcestershire
- 1-2tsp Old Bay
- Squeeze lemon juice from a wedge or two
- Dash of salt (I used sea salt)

## Body

- 1lbish of crab meat, if you use more meat you need more binder. People argue over lump vs claw vs whatever but IDC I just
  throw it all in honestly
- 14 or so saltines depending how much filler you want

## Optional

- Like 1/2 to 1 stick of butter. You can grease the pan with it and then what I did was I melted it and brushed it on top
  the cakes before they went in the oven
- 1 or 2 lemons for serving / making sauce (below)

## Cooking stuff

- Non-stick pan
- (Optional) tinfoil to put on the pan
- Measuring ingredients (I use 1/4 measuring cup to make smaller cakes, you can go smaller / bigger if you want)
- Whisk
- Rubber spatula
- Spatula

## Directions

- Preheat oven, 450F
- Put all the stuff from [Base / Binding](#base--binding) into a bowl and whisk it up
- Add the crab
- Add the saltines
- Fold everything together with the rubber spatula, gently
- Scoop the batter up with your measuring cup, plop on pan and flatten into cake of desired height.
  Mush any stray crab into the cake so they don't fall off
- (Optional) brush melted butter on top
- Bake for 15ish minutes or until you see the edges start to brown (I try to watch mine so they don't overcook)
- Take them out, let them sit for 5-10 minutes, put them on a plate, serve. Squeeze a lemon wedge over a couple if you want that.

## Sriracha sauce

- 2-3 second squirt of sriracha
- 3-4 second squirt of mayonnaise or a couple spoon fulls if you don't have squirt mayo
- squeeze a lemon wedge
- mix it all up

## Old Bay hotsauce sauce

- like 10ish? dashes of old bay hot sauce
- 3-4 second squirt of mayonnaise or a couple spoon fulls if you don't have squirt mayo
- squeeze a lemon wedge
- mix it all up
